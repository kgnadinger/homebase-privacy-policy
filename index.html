    <h1>HomeBase – Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 11/21/2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how HomeBase (“HomeBase,” “the App,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) collects, uses, discloses, and protects personal information. By using HomeBase, you agree to the terms described here.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1. Summary</h2>
    <p>HomeBase is a family household-management tool used to assign chores, track rewards, and manage parent and child profiles. Data is stored primarily in your personal iCloud account via Apple CloudKit. We do not sell personal data or use it for advertising.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Information You Provide</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Household and profile information</li>
        <li>Parent and child passcodes</li>
        <li>Chore details, schedules, and configurations</li>
        <li>Reward point settings</li>
        <li>Optional chore completion photos</li>
        <li>Sign in with Apple identity data</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Device model and OS version</li>
        <li>App version</li>
        <li>Crash logs and performance data</li>
        <li>CloudKit metadata generated by Apple</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Enable household management features</li>
        <li>Sync data using CloudKit</li>
        <li>Authenticate admin users</li>
        <li>Process chore completion and reward points</li>
        <li>Improve app performance</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
    <h3>4.1 iCloud CloudKit</h3>
    <p>Most data is stored in your private iCloud database. We cannot access this data directly.</p>

    <h3>4.2 Future Optional Backend</h3>
    <p>If HomeBase introduces optional backend syncing, you will be notified before data is stored on HomeBase servers.</p>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>HomeBase allows parents to create and manage child profiles. We do not knowingly collect personal information directly from children. All child data is controlled and supervised by a parent or guardian.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or disclose personal information to third parties except as required by law. Apple may process CloudKit data as part of providing iCloud services.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Data remains stored as long as it exists in your iCloud account or is required for household operation. You may delete data manually through App settings or iCloud settings.</p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Delete household data</li>
        <li>Delete profiles</li>
        <li>Remove chore history and photos</li>
        <li>Disable iCloud sync</li>
        <li>Delete HomeBase data from iCloud</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Security</h2>
    <p>We use reasonable technical measures, including iCloud encryption and device-based passcodes. No system is completely secure, and you use the App at your own risk.</p>

    <h2>10. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>HomeBase relies on Apple services such as iCloud, CloudKit, and Sign in with Apple. Their privacy policies apply to your use of these services.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Policy. Continued use of the App after changes means you accept the updated terms.</p>
